# Tailwind-Material

This is a configuration file for Tailwind css which is an excellent framework for Rapid UI development. Currently tailwind doesn't includes any material color schemes. So I created a new configuration file which is included all the material color schemes and shadow effects. For more details, visit Tailwind css official website.
